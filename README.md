# GlibJS - a JavaScript library for advanced object-oriented programming

Everytime you have to craft some non-trivial code in JavaScript you don't bother to respect some rules you would normally follow in any other Object-Oriented language, do you? That's most likely because JavaScript seems so unnatural when it comes to Object-Oriented programming that you cannot adapt to it so easily. You lack some syntax. You struggle with maintaining a project structure most likely ending up having all the logically uncoupled code tied together in just one file. You are confused with the fact that JavaScript is an interpreted language. You don't have a nice IDE. And most importantly, you don't even know what you're doing is right.

## What does it help you with?
It makes writing Object-Oriented applications in JavaScript more like the way you know it from the other languages supporting this paradigm. You are provided with *code templates* to define types, *classloading mechanisms*, *dependency injection* and many more.
