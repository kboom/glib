# GlibJS - a JavaScript library for advanced object-oriented programming

Everytime you have to craft some non-trivial code in JavaScript you don't bother to respect some rules you would normally follow in any other Object-Oriented language, do you? That's most likely because JavaScript seems so unnatural when it comes to Object-Oriented programming that you cannot adapt to it so easily. You lack some syntax. You have problems with designing project structure. You don't know where to start.
